# Chemical-Impurities
Predict chemical impurities based on Spectrograph data and segregate impure from pure chemical

This project investigates the application of machine learning for impurity analysis in
chemical processes and the prediction of cardiac disease using an electrocardiogram. For
Chemicals, the goal is to develop a model that can both identify the type of impurity present
(classification task) and predict its concentration as a percentage (regression task). Similar
machine learning-based approaches are gaining traction in various industrial settings for
real-time process monitoring and quality control. The project evaluates the performance of
the models using metrics like Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) for regression, and Classification
Error. The combined test error decreased from 1293 in the initial weeks to 139 in the last
week. By successfully implementing this combined approach, this project can contribute
to the development of more effcient and reliable methods for impurity analysis in various
industrial processes.
